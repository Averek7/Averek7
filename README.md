# Hi, I'm Avanish Singh 👋

**Blockchain Engineer • Smart Contracts • Web3 Security • Full-Stack Developer**

I build secure, production-ready Web3 systems — from smart contracts and cross-chain infrastructure to full-stack dApps. I enjoy working on problems where security, decentralization, and real-world usability intersect.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🔐 **Blockchain security & risk infrastructure** — fraud detection, wallet risk scoring, oracle-based verification
- 🌉 **Cross-chain systems** — EVM ↔ non-EVM, oracle pipelines, CCIP-style messaging
- 🧠 **Full-stack Web3 apps** — React, Node.js, and smart contract backends
- 🏗️ **Protocol-level design** — governance, validators, staking, registries

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring

- 🤖 **AI Agents & Autonomous Systems** — exploring agent-based architectures, tooling, and how AI agents can augment Web3 security, monitoring, and automation
- 🦀 **Rust-based Blockchain Development** — building and experimenting with Rust projects, focusing on performance, safety, and non-EVM ecosystems

## 🧑‍💻 Experience Snapshot

### Smart Contract Engineer — SentinelAI
- Built a plug-and-play security MVP to classify and mitigate high-risk / fraudulent wallet activity
- Designed multi-layer oracle verification flows for trust-minimized security decisions
- Integrated Chainlink Functions, Automation & CCIP for cross-chain intelligence delivery

### Blockchain Engineer — Merkle Labs
- Developed DeFi & gamified on-chain systems (staking, raffles, casinos, rewards)
- Owned Solidity contracts, tokenomics logic, gas optimization, and real-time integrations
- Shipped 5+ time-sensitive client features improving engagement & retention
